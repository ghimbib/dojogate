    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of DojoGate's website and CRM application (the "Service") operated by DojoGate ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Accounts</h2>
    <p>You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized access at <a href="mailto:support@dojogate.ai">support@dojogate.ai</a>.</p>
    <p>Each account is associated with an organization. The organization admin is responsible for managing team members and permissions within their organization.</p>

    <h2>2. Free Trial</h2>
    <p>New organizations receive a 7-day free trial with access to core features. No credit card is required to start a trial. At the end of the trial period, you must subscribe to a paid plan to continue using the Service. If you do not subscribe, your account will enter a read-only state — your data will be preserved but you will not be able to create or modify records.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscription &amp; Billing</h2>
    <p>Paid plans are billed on a monthly or annual basis at the rates displayed on our pricing page. All fees are in U.S. dollars.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standard:</strong> $100/month or $960/year (save 20%)</li>
      <li><strong>Premium:</strong> $200/month or $1,920/year (save 20%)</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Custom pricing — contact sales</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prices are per organization, not per seat. Payment is processed securely by <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Cancellation &amp; Refunds</h2>
    <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time from your billing settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period — you will retain access until then.</p>
    <p>We do not offer refunds for partial billing periods. If you believe you were charged in error, contact <a href="mailto:support@dojogate.ai">support@dojogate.ai</a> within 14 days.</p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose</li>
      <li>Upload malicious code, viruses, or harmful content</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other accounts or systems</li>
      <li>Scrape, crawl, or extract data from the Service by automated means</li>
      <li>Use the Service to send unsolicited bulk communications (spam)</li>
      <li>Resell or redistribute the Service without our written consent</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service's infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Data</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of all data you upload to the Service ("Your Data"). We do not claim ownership of Your Data. We will not access, use, or share Your Data except as necessary to provide the Service or as described in our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>You may export Your Data at any time using the built-in export features. Upon account deletion, we will delete Your Data within 30 days.</p>

    <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
    <p>We strive to maintain high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted access. We may perform scheduled maintenance with reasonable advance notice. We are not liable for downtime caused by factors outside our control (internet outages, third-party service failures, force majeure).</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service, including its design, code, branding, and documentation, is owned by DojoGate and protected by intellectual property laws. These Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks, logos, or brand assets.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, DojoGate shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or business opportunities, arising from your use of the Service.</p>
    <p>Our total liability for any claim related to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

    <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless DojoGate and its officers, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Modifications</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via email or a notice within the Service. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Colorado, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Colorado.</p>
